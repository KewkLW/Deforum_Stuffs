## Scripts

### blender_export_to_parseq.py

This script provides a addon for Blender, allowing users to export camera motion data from their Blender projects into JSON format intended for [parseq](https://sd-parseq.web.app/). 

## Installation

1. Download the `blender_export_to_parseq.py` file from the repository.

2. Open Blender and go to `Edit > Preferences`.

3. In the Preferences window, switch to the `Add-ons` tab.

4. Click on the `Install...` button at the top of the window.

5. Navigate to the location where you downloaded the `blender_export_to_parseq.py` file, select it, and click `Install Add-on`.

6. The add-on should now appear in the add-on list. However, it might not be enabled yet. To enable it, find it in the list (you can use the search bar) and check the checkbox on the left side.

## Usage
To use it go to file > export > camera diffusion string. 

When exporting, on the right of the window, you will see the various options to swap parameters. You can also choose to not output specfic parameters, and you can increase the scale of the output, but right now it is balanced for use in deform. Most of these are just there for debugging.
